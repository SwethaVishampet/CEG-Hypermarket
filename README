                       WELCOME TO TURBO ASSEMBLER 1.0
                       ------------------------------

This README file contains important, last minute information
about Turbo Assembler 1.0. The HELPME!.DOC file on the TURBO
ASSEMBLER/INSTALLATION disk also answers many common Technical
Support questions.

1. HOW TO GET HELP
------------------

  If you have any problems, please read this file, the HELPME!.DOC
  file, and the Turbo Assembler manuals first. If you still have a
  question and need assistance, help is available from the following
  sources:

  1. Type GO BOR on the CompuServe bulletin board system for
     instant access to the Borland forums with their libraries of
     technical information and answers to common questions.

     If you are not a member of CompuServe, see the enclosed special
     offer, and write for full details on how to receive a free
     IntroPak containing a $15 credit toward your first month's on-
     line charges.

  2. Check with your local software dealer or users' group.

  3. Write to us at the following address:

     Borland International
     Turbo Assembler Technical Support
     1800 Green Hills Road
     P.O. Box 660001
     Scotts Valley, CA  95066-0001

     Please remember to include your serial number or we will be
     unable to process your letter.

  4. If you have an urgent problem that cannot wait and you have sent
     in the license agreement from the front of your manual, you may
     call the Borland Technical Support Department at (408) 438-5300.
     Please have the following information ready before calling:

     a. Product name and serial number on your original distribution
        disk.  Please have your serial number ready or we will be
        unable to process your call.

     b. Product version number. The version number for Turbo Assembler
        is displayed when you run the program.

     c. Computer brand, model, and the brands and model numbers of any
        additional hardware.

     d. Operating system and version number. (The version number can
        be determined by typing VER at the MSDOS prompt.)

     e. Contents of your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

     f. Contents of your CONFIG.SYS file.


2. INSTALLATION
---------------

  This disk contains a program called INSTALL.EXE that will
  assist you with the installation of Turbo Assembler 1.0. There
  are two options for installation:

  1. Hard Disk - This option allows you to pick the subdirectories
     where the files will be loaded.

  2. Floppy Disk - This option will install the files necessary to
     use Turbo Assembler on a two-drive system.  Be sure to have
     four formatted disks ready before you start.

  To start the installation, change your current drive to the one
  that has the install program on it and type INSTALL.  You will
  be given instructions in a box at the bottom of the screen for
  each prompt. For example, if you will be installing from drive
  A:, type

    A:
    INSTALL

  You should read the rest of this README file to get further
  information about this release before you do the installation.


3. IMPORTANT NOTES
------------------

  o Additional tips and answers to many common questions will be found
    in the text file HELPME!.DOC, which has been installed to the same
    location as this file (README). You can use the README.COM utility
    to view the HELPME!.DOC file by giving the following command:

      README HELPME!.DOC

  o If you will be running INSTALL on a laptop or any other system
    that uses an LCD display, you should set your system into black
    and white mode before running INSTALL. You can do this from DOS
    with the following command line:

      mode bw80

    or, you can force INSTALL to come up in black and white mode by
    using the /b switch:

      install /b

  o Changed Switches for OBJXREF:

    The /O option (object files directory) has been changed to
    the /D (directories) option. The switch now allows for
    multiple search directories to be specified. The new syntax
    follows:

     OBJXREF /Ddir1[;dir2[;dir3]]

       or

     OBJXREF /Ddir1 [/Ddir2] [/Ddir3]

    OBJXREF will search each of the directories in the specified
    order for all object and library files. If no /D option is
    used, only the current directory will be searched. However,
    if a /D option is used, the current directory will NOT be
    searched unless it is included in the directory list. For
    example, to first search the BORLAND directory for files and
    then search the current directory, you would type

      OBJXREF /Dborland;.

    If multiple search directories are specified and a file
    matching the file specification is found, OBJXREF will
    include the file as part of the cross-reference. OBJXREF will
    only continue to search the other directories for the same
    file specification if the file specification contains
    wildcards.

    A new option has been added to allow you to specify an output
    file where OBJXREF will send any reports generated. The new
    option is the /O option, and it has the following syntax:

      OBJXREF myfile.obj /RU /Ofilename.ext

    By default, all output is sent to the console.

  o Turbo Linker (TLINK) Notes:

    1) When linking with the /V option, TLINK will initialize all
    segments. If you have a program that runs differently when
    linked with debug information, you have an uninitialized
    variable somewhere.

    2) TLINK loads last any segments of class 'STACK' even if
    they are part of DGROUP.


5. MANUAL ADDITIONS AND CORRECTIONS
-----------------------------------

  Additions and corrections to the manual will be found in the text
  file MANUAL.DOC, which has been installed to the same location as
  this file (README). You can use the README.COM utility to view the
  MANUAL.DOC file by giving the following command:
